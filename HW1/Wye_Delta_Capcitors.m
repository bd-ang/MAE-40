%% Exercise 10.2 
% Following an analogous derivation as that in Example 10.3, replace the six resistors in Figure
% 10.4a-b with six capacitors {C1, C2, C3, Ca, Cb, Cc}, and write a code Wye_Delta_Capacitors.m that quanti-
% fies {Ca, Cb, Cc} in terms of {C1, C2, C3}, and vice versa, so that the two circuits are equivalent. Then, replacing
% the five resistors in Figure 10.3d with ve capacitors {C1, C2, C3, C4, C5} and applying this result, compute the
% equivalent capacitance C of this network.
